# Data Structures and Algorithms using C

This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms using the C programming language.

## Introduction

Data structures and algorithms are fundamental concepts in computer science that every programmer should be familiar with. This repository serves as a resource for learning and understanding these concepts through practical implementations in C.

## Table of Contents

1. [Arrays as Abstract Data Types](./Arrays_as_abstract_datatypes)
2. [Circular Linked List](./Circular_LL)
3. [Doubly Linked List](./Doubly_linked_list)
4. [Linked List](./Linked_List)
5. [Queue](./Queue)
6. [Sorting Algorithms](./Sorting)
7. [Stacks](./Stacks)
8. [Trees](./Trees)

## How to Use

Each directory in this repository corresponds to a specific data structure or algorithm. Inside each directory, you will find the C source code files along with any necessary header files.

To use the code:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory of the data structure or algorithm you are interested in.
3. Compile the C source code files using a C compiler of your choice.
4. Run the compiled executable to see the implementation in action.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to contribute to this project, you can:
