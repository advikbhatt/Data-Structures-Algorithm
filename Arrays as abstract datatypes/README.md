Data Structure and Algorithm 
This explanation of how arrays are created dynamically is represented where we can make an array with a fixed amount of memory in use and reserve the remaining memory for other purposes and to optimize the code.
we can dynamically allocate the memory in the abstract data type for arrays and use them accordingly.
